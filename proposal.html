    <h1>Problem and Data Domain</h1>
    <p>Over the course of my entire life playing games, something I would often struggle with was deciding what would play next. 
        Whether it be mood, not having enough time, or having already beat many of said games, there are times where people don’t 
        know what to play next. Video game decision making can be a problem for many others as well, as they are consumers who spend money 
        on products. Having some sort of application to address indecisiveness and give suggestions may prove to help alleviate this 
        issue. I would often look online, but there was never a focused database of games, where one could look for games based on genre, 
        time, or ratings. Sites like <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/">howlongtobeat.com</a> or <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/">metacritic.com</a> 
        have info for ratings and length to beat, but these were never consolidated into one main database or even provided suggestions 
        based on user input. A web page that can suggest a couple games to play based on various filters and tags may prove useful for 
        decision making. Given the current times with COVID, video games are a great way for people to spend their time indoors and 
        provide hours of entertainment at home.

    <h1>App Description</h1>
    <p>The main users of the app will be general video game consumers and gaming enthusiasts. General video game consumers will be 
        more of a casual audience of people who are unsure of what games to purchase, while gaming enthusiasts would be those in 
        search of their next game to play. Users will be viewing information provided by howlongtobeat.com and metacritic.com based 
        on categories such as rating, genre, and game length. There are is an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/howlongtobeat">API from npm</a> 
        to obtain and access howlongtobeat data, while there is a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/skateddu/metacritic-games-stats-20112019">.csv file</a> 
        for metacritic game stats. 
    </p>
    <p>In terms of functionality, this web app aims to suggest games for users to play, based on the type of data they input. Users 
        can use their own list of games they have to search for games to replay, or use the database of games to be given a list of 
        potential games to play. Potential interactions may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching for games based on a variety of tags or labels</li>
        <li>Adding games you have played to a list</li>
        <li>Suggesting games based on game length, genre, ratings, or one’s game list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This app should help users be able to make more educated and favorable choices based on their input, while also providing a way 
        for people to go through old and new experiences with games. Additionally, this app also looks at how info on video games is 
        spread out throughout multiple sites, and would consolidate all into one!
